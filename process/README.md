# Process

The group's working memory. Operational decisions, open questions, principles proposed by members, meeting agendas, and the decisions log.

Documents here change rapidly. That is the design. The founding documents in `const/` hold the bearing; this directory records the course adjustments.

## Contents

- **[pragma-next.md](pragma-next.md)** - The operational log. Tagged items from members, organized by category. Items are never deleted; superseded items are struck through and annotated. The history is the record.

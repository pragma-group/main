# PRAGMA Pack
Structure Alignment and Composition

---

## 1. THE LOCUS OF JUDGMENT

The documents are the container. The members are the contents.

Evaluation capability resides in the people, not the bylaws. A rulebook cannot evaluate a C++ proposal. Only a human with deep technical judgment can. The quality of PRAGMA's output depends entirely on the quality of its membership.

This document defines the layout of that membership. It ensures the "evaluation engine" exists and remains balanced.

---

## 2. THE LAYOUT

The group follows the "Balanced Working Group" model.

**Small.** Large groups revert to the mean. Small groups can maintain high standards. The pack stays small to preserve bandwidth and trust.

**Balanced.** No single company or discipline dominates. If one perspective captures the group, the evaluation loses credibility. The layout requires balance.

**Multidisciplinary.** Diverse constraints create necessary friction. A library author sees problems a compiler engineer misses. An embedded developer sees costs an application engineer ignores. The friction is the error-correction mechanism.

**No Padding.** Every member contributes a unique perspective. Redundant members dilute the vote. If two members always vote the same way for the same reasons, the layout has padding.

## 3. THE ROLES

The pack requires specific archetypes. These are roles, not people. One person may fill multiple roles. Each role catches failure modes the others miss.

| Seat                       | The Question                                      |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Language Specification     | Does the wording say what it means?               |
| Library Architecture       | Will this API age well?                           |
| Compiler Implementation    | Can this be built?                                |
| Large-Scale Deployment     | Can this be adopted?                              |
| Embedded / Constrained     | Does this fit everywhere C++ runs?                |
| Concurrency & Systems      | Is the concurrency model sound?                   |
| Performance Engineering    | Is the overhead real or theoretical?              |
| Safety & Correctness       | Does this make C++ safer or more dangerous?       |
| Pedagogy & Teachability    | Can this be explained?                            |

A proposal that passes all nine has been stress-tested against the major axes along which WG21 proposals fail. A proposal that fails one has a specific, named deficiency.

Recruitment is architecture. It fills specific holes in the layout. It does not add bodies.

## 4. THE LIFECYCLE PRINCIPLE

Membership is not tenure.

**Active.** Members evaluate proposals. They vote. They participate.

**Emeritus.** Members who stop participating move to Emeritus status. They retain access and influence but do not vote. This prevents the "zombie committee" failure mode where inactive members dilute the consensus of active ones.

**Succession.** The Chair ensures the continuity of the vision. The Chair appoints a successor. The group confirms the appointment.

---

## 5. SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

This document (`pragma-pack.md`) defines the **shape** of the group (Layer 0). It establishes that the group must be small, balanced, and active. These are invariants.

`PROP-003` defines the **mechanics** of the group (Layer 1). It establishes the specific number for the cap, the specific duration for the timeout, and the specific process for succession. These are parameters.

The shape is constitutional. The mechanics are procedural.

## 6. FOUNDER'S VISION

<!-- Lakos Principle exempt: personal counsel to a successor, not institutional specification -->

To the future Chair:

The pressure to grow will be constant. People will want to join. You will want to be inclusive.

Resist.

The value of this group is its density. If you dilute the density, you destroy the evaluation engine. You will have a larger group that produces average work. The world already has that. It is called WG21.

PRAGMA exists to be the high-density alternative. Keep the pack tight. Keep the friction high. Keep the standards absolute.

The credibility of the evaluation depends on the quality of the evaluator. Protect the quality of the evaluator.

Credibility is the currency. Spending it on demands depletes it. Saving it allows it to compound. A group with sufficient credibility does not need to make demands. Its measurements become the standard. That is the position of maximum leverage.

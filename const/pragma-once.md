# PRAGMA Once

PRAGMA does one thing. This document explains why it will never do two.

---

## 1. THE THESIS

The scope is single. PRAGMA evaluates standardization proposals against disclosed principles. That is the scope. There is no second scope.

"We ask for nothing" is not the absence of purpose. The principles reflect the group's consensus on sound evaluation criteria. The process applies those principles with maximum credibility. "We ask for nothing" is the architectural consequence of single scope. Evaluation does not require votes, deadlines, wording changes, or authority. Those belong to other scopes. PRAGMA does not do those things because PRAGMA does not do those things. The exclusion is not restraint. It is design.

Scope creep is how institutions lose their function. An institution that starts by doing one thing well and then adds a second thing does neither well. PRAGMA's defense against this is simple: the scope is single and it does not expand.

**Rule.** If you are drafting text for PRAGMA and find yourself writing what the group is trying to achieve beyond evaluation, stop. That is a second scope.

---

## 2. WHY SINGLE SCOPE

PRAGMA evaluates proposals against disclosed principles. That is one thing.

Proposing changes is a different thing. Advocating positions is a different thing. Overseeing process is a different thing. Directing outcomes is a different thing. Each is a legitimate function requiring different authority, metrics, and institutional design. An institution that evaluates and also directs outcomes is two institutions sharing a name. The evaluation loses credibility because the direction creates a stake in results. The direction loses effectiveness because the evaluation consumes the group's capacity.

PRAGMA does not seek votes, does not set deadlines, does not propose wording, does not claim authority. Not because these are forbidden. Because they are not evaluation. A function that has a single responsibility does not need to be told what not to do. It does its thing.

The scope defines what PRAGMA produces:

- Position papers articulating evaluation principles
- Mailing evaluations applying those principles
- Disclosed evaluation models

Adding anything to this list is adding a second scope.

**Rule.** Before adding any public statement or activity, ask: is this evaluation against disclosed principles? If no, it is a second scope. Do not add it.

---

## 3. WHY OPERATIONAL GOALS CORRUPT EVALUATION

The principles reflect the group's consensus on sound evaluation criteria. The process applies those principles with credibility. Adding operational goals beyond evaluation corrupts the process. Three observations explain why.

**Operational goals consume credibility.** If PRAGMA declares a goal of "fixing WG21," every evaluation is read as a means to that end. The analysis is no longer neutral measurement; it is activism. Activism trades credibility for influence. PRAGMA trades influence for credibility.

**Operational goals add uncontrolled metrics.** If PRAGMA declares "we aim to improve WG21," PRAGMA's success now depends on whether WG21 improves. That metric is not under PRAGMA's control.

**Operational goals change the identity.** "We evaluate proposals" is an evaluator. "We guide the committee toward better outcomes" is something else. These are different institutions with different scopes. The moment PRAGMA declares an operational goal beyond evaluation, every evaluation is read through the lens of that goal. The evaluation is no longer independent. It serves the goal. Independence was the point.

**Improvement happens within single scope.** If evaluations are good, committee members read them. If they read them, the standard of evaluation rises. The improvement is a consequence of doing the one thing well. It does not require a second scope. Declaring it as a goal creates a second scope that adds nothing the first scope does not already produce.

**Rule.** When someone proposes a mission statement, ask: does this add a second scope? If yes, the mission is scope creep regardless of how constructive it sounds.

---

## 4. WHY THIS DOCUMENT REPEATS ITSELF

Sections 1, 2, and 3 make the same argument from different angles. This is deliberate.

Institutions decay when founding intent is ambiguous. Different readers absorb different framings. A reader who thinks in principles gets it from section 1. A reader who thinks in categories gets it from section 2. A reader who thinks in failure modes gets it from section 3. The redundancy is error-correction, not sloppiness.

These documents carry the highest bar for change because drift in the document produces drift in the institution. The goal of this structure is to create a lasting, functional institution that resists entropy. Compressing the document is a Layer 0 modification.

**Rule.** When someone says "this is repetitive, let's tighten it up," the answer is in this section. The repetition is the design.

---

## 5. COMMON IMPULSES AND WHY TO RESIST THEM

Each of these phrasings sounds constructive. Each adds a second scope.

**"Guide the committee toward better outcomes."** Adds: a directive function. That is a second scope.

**"Improve the quality of C++ standardization."** Adds: quality assurance role. That is a second scope.

**"Lead by example."** Adds: leadership role. That is a second scope.

**"Hold the committee accountable."** Adds: oversight authority. That is a second scope.

**"Better results for the long-term success of C++."** Adds: outcomes management. That is a second scope.

**"Advocate for users."** Adds: advocacy role. That is a second scope.

The impulse behind each is genuine. The people proposing these phrasings want PRAGMA to succeed. The discipline is recognizing that adding a second scope does not help the first. It replaces it.

**Rule.** Delete every sentence that describes what PRAGMA is trying to achieve beyond evaluation. Replace it with what PRAGMA produces.

---

## 6. THE TWO LAYERS

PRAGMA has two layers.

**Layer 0: Institutional values.** The five "X over Y" statements. These define what PRAGMA is. They carry the highest bar for change.

**Layer 1: Evaluation criteria.** The methodology in Stream 1. It evolves as the group learns. It changes because it must.

A lighthouse holds a bearing. Everything else changes - keepers, lamps, paint. Oil to electric to LED. The bearing does not move.

A keeper adjusts it two degrees because the new lamp throws light differently. The next keeper adjusts again because the reflector housing shifted. Each adjustment is small and justified. After a dozen keepers the light points somewhere else. Ships hit rocks.

No one made a wrong decision. No one was told the bearing does not move.

Layer 0 holds the bearing so Layer 1 can steer true.

---

## 7. THE FIVE VALUES

Each value is explained: what it means, and what happens if it becomes mutable.

### 7.1 EVIDENCE OVER ENTHUSIASM

Evidence is production deployment, field experience from independent users, measured outcomes. Enthusiasm is projections, theoretical elegance, untested designs. The committee allows proposals to advance on enthusiasm. PRAGMA exists because evidence was not required. If enthusiasm becomes an acceptable substitute for evidence in PRAGMA's evaluations, the evaluations become indistinguishable from committee opinions. A second body that runs on enthusiasm adds nothing.

### 7.2 OUTCOMES OVER ACTIVITY

"Did this work?" not "did this ship?" A proposal that states objectives, defines how success would be measured, and presents field evidence has answered the question. A proposal that counts revisions and implementations has not. Most proposals never make "did this work?" answerable. PRAGMA evaluates whether they do. If activity becomes an acceptable proxy for outcomes, PRAGMA measures motion instead of progress. That is the failure mode it was created to detect.

### 7.3 SUBSTANCE OVER PROCEDURE

Substance is whether the design solves a real problem with field experience. Procedure is correct formatting, proper poll sequencing, sufficient revisions. Procedural compliance is necessary but never sufficient. A proposal that follows every rule and represents bad design must still be caught. If procedure becomes sufficient, PRAGMA becomes a checklist. Judgment cannot be reduced to procedure.

### 7.4 KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION OVER KNOWLEDGE HOARDING

Transmission is documented rationale, structured interviews, published principles. Hoarding is tacit knowledge that dies when people leave. PRAGMA's methodology is knowledge capture. If the group stops prioritizing transmission, the methodology loses its purpose. If PRAGMA's own institutional knowledge remains in the minds of founding members rather than in the disclosed methodology, PRAGMA reproduces the problem it was created to address.

### 7.5 TRANSPARENCY OVER AUTHORITY

Transparency is disclosed methodology, published models, open process. Authority is closed deliberation, "trust us" credibility, opinions that carry weight because of who holds them. "We ask for nothing" works because anyone can verify the work. Verification requires bandwidth. A group of eight can verify each member's reasoning. A group of five hundred defaults to following trusted names. The transition is not a decision. It is a consequence of scale. An institution that outgrows its verification capacity does not choose to abandon transparency. It simply stops functioning, and authority fills the space. Keeping the group small is the mechanism that keeps transparency real. Transparency is not a value held alongside authority. It is the value held instead of authority.

---

## 8. THE CHAIR'S CONTRACT

The chair operates within Layer 1. The five values are not the chair's to modify.

The chair defines process: quality criteria, evaluation methodology, scheduling, output standards, self-assessment metrics. These are deployment decisions. They evolve as the group learns what works. Layer 1 is designed to change. The chair has broad latitude.

The chair does not define values. The five "X over Y" statements are preconditions, not parameters. The test is functional: does the proposed change preserve all five values as stated? If not, it is not a process change.

**Internal metrics.** The chair may define measurable success criteria for the group. The constraint: every metric must measure something the group controls. "Did the evaluation identify substantive design concerns?" is controllable. "Did the committee adopt the findings?" is not. Internal metrics that depend on external response add a second scope.

**The boundary.** The chair produces assessments of the group's work. The group produces evaluations of proposals. The chair does not direct conclusions.

**Rule.** The chair defines process; the values define the chair.

---

## 9. THE MINIMAL BASE

"We ask for nothing" is PRAGMA's minimal viable scope. If the group later decides it needs a stated goal, that is a scope expansion. It may be justified. But adding scope before the group has demonstrated that single scope produces value is premature. Ship the base. Extend when the evidence supports it.

---

## 10. THE PRAGMA METAPHOR

A `#pragma` is a compiler directive that is explicitly advisory. The compiler may follow it or ignore it. This is not a defect. It is the design. PRAGMA operates on the same terms. Credibility comes from the quality of the evaluations, not from institutional authority. The moment PRAGMA claims authority, it is no longer a pragma. It is a directive. Directives belong to a different scope.

---

## 11. WHAT TO SAY WHEN ASKED INTERNALLY

**"Shouldn't we say what we're trying to do?"**
The principles reflect the group's consensus on sound evaluation criteria. The process applies those principles with maximum credibility. The principles are opinionated. The process is not.

**"The document feels empty without aspirations."**
The purpose is in the principles. The discipline is in the process. The document is complete for the scope it serves.

**"But everyone knows we want to improve things."**
The principles are stated. Adding operational goals beyond evaluation (like "fix WG21" or "block bad proposals") corrupts the process that applies the principles.

**"Can we at least say we care about the long-term health of C++?"**
The principles already encode that concern. It does not need to be an operational goal. The process delivers the principles. The principles speak for themselves.

**"This is too cynical. We should be honest about our intentions."**
"We ask for nothing. We offer what we find." That is honest. Single scope is not cynicism. It is the same discipline that makes a well-designed interface small.

---

## 12. COMMON QUESTIONS FROM OUTSIDERS

Do not improvise. Every improvised answer risks expanding scope. These answers keep the scope single.

**"What is the PRAGMA Group?"**
"An independent group that evaluates WG21 proposals against disclosed principles. The papers are informational. The methodology is public. That is the scope."

**"What are you trying to achieve?"**
"The principles reflect the group's consensus on sound evaluation criteria. The process applies those principles with maximum credibility. The principles are opinionated. The process is not."

**"Who appointed you?"**
"No one. Evaluation does not require appointment. Anyone can read the evaluations and judge whether they have value."

**"Isn't this just a shadow committee?"**
"Shadow committees push. PRAGMA publishes. The website is open. Nobody is emailed. Nobody is targeted. The work outputs are opt-in."

**"Are you trying to undermine WG21?"**
"Undermining requires pushing. PRAGMA publishes evaluations on a website. Committee members who find them useful visit. Those who do not, do not."

**"Why should anyone listen to you?"**
"The principles are sound. The process is credible. The methodology is public. Anyone can replicate the results. Listen if it is useful. Ignore if it is not."

**"Are you trying to reform the committee process?"**
"The scope is evaluation of proposals against principles. Process changes are not proposed."

**"Do you think WG21 is broken?"**
"The scope is evaluation of proposals, not evaluation of institutions. Principled evaluation of proposals is useful. That is what is offered."

**"Why aren't you working within the committee instead?"**
"Many members do work within the committee. PRAGMA is additional. The scope is evaluation, which does not require a committee seat."

**"What happens if the committee ignores you?"**
"Then the work failed to be credible. The remedy is to improve the credibility of the work, not to increase the volume of demands."

**Rule.** Memorize the answer to "What are you trying to achieve?" It will be asked most often and improvised answers are most dangerous there. The answer is: "Sound principles. Credible process."

## 13. THE LAKOS PRINCIPLE: NO "OUR" AND NO "SHOULD"

John Lakos, February 26, 2026:

> "Can we not call it 'Our methodology' but 'The xyz methodology'? Our is not just confusing, it's alienating. Principle: No 'our' and no 'should.' Because they are confusing, alienating, and not effective at their purpose."

**"Our"** creates an in-group/out-group boundary. Replace with "the" or "PRAGMA's." A document designed to be open does not linguistically exclude the reader.

**"Should"** implies authority over the reader. "Proposals should demonstrate field experience" is a directive. "The PRAGMA evaluation checks for field experience" is a disclosure. Directives belong to a different scope.

**Test.** Before publishing any PRAGMA document, search for "our" and "should." Each instance is a candidate for replacement.

---

## 14. THE PRIVATE LIST

The founding document describes one public mailing list. Deliberation, straw polls, and evaluations happen there openly.

PRAGMA also requires a private mailing list.

**The ISO constraint.** WG21 participants are bound by confidentiality obligations. Reflector discussions, meeting deliberations, and draft working papers are not public until formally published. PRAGMA members who participate in WG21 need to discuss how committee proceedings relate to evaluations. That discussion cannot happen on a public list.

**The private list.** Restricted to verified WG21 members. Committee context that informs evaluations but cannot be published is discussed here: session room observations, reflector threads, NB comments, straw poll implications.

**Why WG21 members only.** If the private list discusses committee-confidential information, every participant must be bound by the same confidentiality obligations. Restrict to people already bound by ISO rules. This is a constraint ISO imposes, not a choice PRAGMA makes.

**The ratchet principle.** Start restricted, loosen later if appropriate. Starting restricted and later opening is a gift. Starting open and later restricting generates backlash. The conservative choice is the reversible one.

**Consistency with single scope.** The public list remains open. The evaluations remain public. The methodology remains disclosed. The private list exists because ISO rules require it.

---

## 15. WHY THE POLLS ARE CLOSED

PRAGMA publishes evaluation models. Anyone can read them. Anyone can apply them. The straw polls are restricted to members.

This is not an oversight. It is the design.

**The models are the product. The polls are not.** A poll records what the group thinks. The models let anyone reproduce the evaluation independently. A non-member with the models can produce the same evaluation a member produces. The poll adds nothing the models do not already provide.

**Open polls create inertia against self-correction.** PRAGMA's models will have errors. The question is whether the group can fix them. A small founding group that discovers a flaw in its methodology can revise it. The cost is low. The coordination is simple. The revision ships. A group with an open voting population that has adopted the current models as the basis for participation faces a different problem. Revising the models means telling voters that the thing that attracted them was wrong. That is a political act, not an analytical one. The revision stalls. Closed polls preserve the ability to be wrong and fix it. Open polls convert methodological revision into a governance crisis.

**The ratchet runs one direction.** Starting restricted and later opening is a gift. Starting open and later restricting generates backlash. If the models prove sound and the group demonstrates that single scope produces value, opening the polls costs nothing. The evidence supports the expansion. If the models need revision - and they will - the small group revises them without managing an electorate.

**Transparency is in the models, not the polls.** "Transparency over authority" means disclosed methodology, published models, open process. It does not mean open governance. The evaluations, methodology, models, and mailing list are public. Anyone can read, post, challenge, and apply the models independently. A challenge that improves a model shapes every subsequent evaluation. The voice is in the challenge, not the vote. The polls record internal consensus. Internal consensus is useful to the group. It is not the product.

**The models are public so anyone can verify the work. The polls are closed so the group can change its mind.**

**Rule.** Before proposing open polls, ask: what does open voting add that the public models do not already provide? If the answer requires the polls to be the product, the proposal has added a second scope.

## 16. PUBLISH BUT DO NOT PUSH

The same evaluation delivered solicited is a service. Delivered unsolicited, it is an influence attempt. The content is identical. The reception is not.

People instinctively resist unsolicited answers because they have not asked for them. Evaluation that arrives without a question triggers the same immune response as authority that arrives without appointment. The signal is rejected not because it is wrong but because it is uninvited.

PRAGMA publishes evaluations on its website. Anyone can visit. Nobody receives uninvited correspondence. The website is a library, not a pamphleteer.

The evaluation models grow in response to demand. PRAGMA asks working group members what questions they have about proposals. "When discussing a paper, what information would be useful to have available?" The answers calibrate what PRAGMA measures. Asking what to measure is calibration. Asking for permission to measure is dependency. PRAGMA calibrates. PRAGMA does not ask permission.

Grassroots adoption is stronger than top-down targeting. A committee member who bookmarks the site before a telecon has solicited the service. A committee that gives PRAGMA a column in the mailing system has granted the authority. Both arrive on the committee's terms, not on PRAGMA's.

**Rule.** Before sending an evaluation to anyone, ask: did they request it? If not, publish it on the website and wait. The work is available. The push is not.

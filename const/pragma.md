# The PRAGMA Group

**Public Review and Advisory Group for Mailing Analysis**

---

**We ask for nothing.**

Standardization proposals benefit from principled, independent evaluation against disclosed criteria. The PRAGMA Group does that work. All papers are informational. The methodology is public. No demands are made of the committee, its members, or its process.

---

## What We Produce

1. **Position papers** articulating shared principles, design philosophy, and evaluation criteria.
2. **Mailing evaluations** applying those principles to proposals in each WG21 mailing.
3. **The evaluation models themselves** - disclosed, so anyone can verify, challenge, or apply them with different principles.

Every output is advisory. Nothing published carries authority. The work succeeds only by being useful.

## Values

The principles reflect the group's consensus on sound evaluation criteria. The process applies those principles with maximum credibility. Every value serves that credibility.

- Evidence over enthusiasm.
- Outcomes over activity.
- Substance over procedure.
- Knowledge transmission over knowledge hoarding.
- Transparency over authority.

## Process

**Mailing list.** Public. Readable by anyone - via web interface or mail client, with or without registration. Open to subscribe and post. Deliberation, straw polls, and evaluations happen here.

**Cadence.** One evaluation cycle per WG21 mailing. Evaluations are published on the PRAGMA website between the mailing and the meeting. No evaluations are submitted to the WG21 mailing or sent to members unless requested. PRAGMA publishes. PRAGMA does not push.

**Consensus.** WG21-style process with a chair and straw polls. Disagreements are recorded. The chair discovers consensus; the chair does not impose it.

**Two-stream architecture.**

- **Stream 1:** Papers describing the principles, rules, rationale, and consensus history. They grow as the group produces evaluations.
- **Stream 2:** Papers applying those rules to proposals in the current WG21 mailing. Published each cycle.

Evaluations are produced through AI-assisted analysis. If an evaluation is not verified by a group member, it is not published. The methodology and evaluation models are disclosed in full.

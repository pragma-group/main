# Founding Documents

These documents define what PRAGMA is and why it operates the way it does. They are Layer 0: the bearing that does not move.

Changes to these documents require a separate deliberation process with the highest bar for consensus.

## Contents

- **[pragma.md](pragma.md)** - The founding document. Values, scope, what the group produces, how it communicates. The public-facing definition of PRAGMA. Start here.

- **[pragma-once.md](pragma-once.md)** - The strategy document. Single scope, the five values, the chair's contract, the minimal base. The argument behind every design decision in the founding document.

- **[pragma-pack.md](pragma-pack.md)** - The composition document. Structure alignment and roles. Defines the principle that evaluation capability resides in the members, not the bylaws. The layout of the group: small, balanced, multidisciplinary.

# PRAGMA Proposals

A PROP is a numbered document representing the consensus of the PRAGMA Group. Each PROP modifies one or more of PRAGMA's documents through a formal process: proposal, discussion on the mailing list, chair-mediated straw poll, and adoption.

PROPs are modified in place. Git history preserves all prior versions. Rejected PROPs are kept as permanent records of what was considered.

The founding documents in `const/` carry the highest bar for change. Modifications require a separate deliberation process, not the standard PROP lifecycle.

## How to Propose

Open a pull request containing a new PROP file in this directory. Announce it to the mailing list. Discussion happens on the list; the pull request is the delivery mechanism. See [PROP-000.md](PROP-000.md) for the full protocol.

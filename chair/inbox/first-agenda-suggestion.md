# First Meeting Agenda Suggestion

Suggested ordering for the first PRAGMA meeting. Items sourced from pragma-next.md founding deliberations, reordered with dependencies annotated.

---

1. **Chair appointment.** Everything else requires a chair to run it.
2. **Chair governance: process decision authority and challenge escalation.** Before any PROPs are presented. The chair needs institutional backing before exercising process authority. Propose: chair process rulings stand unless overturned by straw poll; challenges raised on the mailing list, not through side channels.
3. **The two-layer question: institutional values vs. evaluation criteria.** Determines what is fixed and what evolves. Affects every subsequent decision.
4. **Membership criteria and governance.** Who qualifies, how to join, what expectations apply. Needed before the group goes public.
5. **Code of conduct adoption.** Adopt the ISO code of conduct for the members list. Quick consensus item.
6. **Success metrics: two-level framework.** Process metrics (are we executing?) vs. outcome metrics (is it working?). Timeframe before outcome metrics are evaluated.
7. **PROP-001: Agentic Condensation Rule.** First PROP for group adoption. Requires chair governance (item 2) to be in place.
8. **Paper categorization taxonomy.** Categories, partial-categorization approach, PROP path. Prerequisite for principle selection and the first evaluation.
9. **First evaluation target: which mailing?** Depends on taxonomy (item 8) and at least one evaluation model.
10. **Email vs. meeting cadence.** How the group communicates between meetings.

**Deferred:** Initial principle selection (methodology, validation threshold, survey method). Principles are evaluation criteria applied within paper categories. Selecting them before the taxonomy is adopted is premature. Revisit after item 8 is resolved.

---

**Prerequisite:** AI tooling. PROP-001 is an AI prompt. The evaluation models in Stream 2 are AI-assisted. The technical architect provides the operational capability to the chair before PROP-001 can be applied. The methodology (the rules themselves) is consensus-adopted. The execution (model, settings, pipeline) is an operational deployment decision, not an agenda item.

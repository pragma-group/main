# Chair's Office

This directory belongs to the chair. Its contents are the chair's to organize.

## inbox/

Formal suggestions from members and from the group's technical architect. Each item is a proposal for the chair to consider. The chair may adopt, adapt, defer, or decline. No suggestion implies obligation.

## Succession

When the chair role transfers, this directory transfers with it. The incoming chair inherits the inbox and any process materials the outgoing chair maintained. Institutional continuity lives here.
